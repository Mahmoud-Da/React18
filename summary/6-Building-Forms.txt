Summary
• To handle form submissions, we set the onSubmit attribute of the form element.

• We can use the ref hook to access elements in the DOM. This technique is often used to
read the value of input fields upon submitting a form.

• We can also use the state hook to create state variables and update them as the user
types into input fields. With this technique, every time the user types a character into an
input field, the component containing the form gets re-rendered. While in theory this
can cause a performance penalty, in practice this is often negligible.

• React Hook Form is a popular library that helps us build forms quickly with less code.
With React Hook Form, we no longer have to worry about using the ref or state hooks
to manage the form state.

• React Hook Form supports the standard HTML attributes for data validation such as
required, minLength, etc.

• We can validate our forms using schema-based validation libraries such as joi, yup, zod,
etc. With these libraries, we can define all our validation rules in a single place called a
schema.
